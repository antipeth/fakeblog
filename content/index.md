In shadows deep where secrets dwell,
The moonlight weaves a silver spell.

Steel whispers dance on midnight air,
A rebel heart, unbound, laid bare.

Stars ignite like fireflies' flight,
In the city's pulse, we own the night.

Chasing dreams on a razor's edge,
With every step, we make our pledge.

Echoes of freedom, wild and free,
Breaking chains, just you and me.

Together we'll ride the storm's embrace,
In this cool world, we'll find our place.
